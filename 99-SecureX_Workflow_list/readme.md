# Cool SecureX Workflows

I share with you here some very cool SecureX workflow made by a lot of SecureX Afficionados.


### Disclaimer
None of these workflows had been validated by Cisco !  They are All Proof Of concepts !   they all must be reviewed before going to production !!!

But you will find into each of them a lot of very good programming technics
