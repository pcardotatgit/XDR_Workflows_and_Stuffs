# Create SecureX Incidents from apache log

This use case is about creating Incidents and attached sigthings within SecureX from apache web server logs analysis

When you expose a Web server on the INTERNET this one is rapidly discovered ( in 4 hoursmax ) and then we start to see Web Attacks attempts.

A lot of these attacks are clearly visible in the apache logs.

The rationnal for this use case is to analise any apache logs and automatically create Incidents within SecureX for every discovered attack. And then populate SecureX blocking Feeds with ip addresses of Hackers.
