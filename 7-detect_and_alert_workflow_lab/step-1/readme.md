For our needs, we don't have to take care about the BOT logic. We are only interested by the Webex Team Bot itself as an Webex Entity that has the capability to send Webex messages thanks to a never expire Webex Token.

And we need a webex Team Room to send alert messages into it on behalf of our bot.

Go to SecureX and create a Target for your Webex Team Bot. Once done create a basic SecureX workflow that will take as an input any string and will send it to your Alert Webex Team Room created above. Make it atomic.
