# SecureX Workflows and Tutos

This repository intends to gather some SecureX tutorials that help on Workflow and Integration Modules creation.

## Targets

In this section you will find some information about how to create SecureX Targets.

**Notice** : a lot of these targets already exist within SecureX. Meaning you don't have to create them.

These examples below cover differents Targets scenarios that will be common in production environments. And the goal is to show how we can create them step by step.

* [Create step by step a Webex Team Bot Target - example of HTTP bearer token target ](https://github.com/pcardotatgit/SecureX_Workflows_and_Stuffs/tree/master/1-Create_a_Webex_Team_Bot_Target)
* [Create step by step a Networking Device target - example of SSH target](https://github.com/pcardotatgit/SecureX_Workflows_and_Stuffs/tree/master/2-Create_a_Networking_Device_Target)
* [Create step by step a FTD Device target - example of Basic + Bearer token authentication (  Oauth )](https://github.com/pcardotatgit/SecureX_Workflows_and_Stuffs/tree/master/3-Create_a_onbox_Managed_FTD_Target)
* [Create step by step a Secure Endpoint Target - example of HTTP Basic authentication Target ](https://github.com/pcardotatgit/SecureX_Workflows_and_Stuffs/tree/master/4-Create_an_AMP_Target)
* [Threat Response Target - an example of Oauth target ( basic + Bearer token )](https://github.com/pcardotatgit/SecureX_Workflows_and_Stuffs/tree/master/7-ask_for_a_threat_response_token)

## Triggers

In this section you will find some tutorials dedicated to triggers which can Start SecureX workflows.

* [Trigger your workflows from the pivot menu](https://github.com/pcardotatgit/SecureX_Workflows_and_Stuffs/tree/master/5-Trigger_your_workflow_from_the_ribbon)
* [Trigger your workflows from Webhooks](https://github.com/pcardotatgit/SecureX_Workflows_and_Stuffs/tree/master/10-trigger_your_workflow_with_webhooks)


## Miscelaneous 

In this section some usefull tutorials.

* [JSON Parsing ( secureX and python )](https://github.com/pcardotatgit/SecureX_Workflows_and_Stuffs/tree/master/9-JSON_Parsing_within_SecureX)

## Use Cases

In this section you will find some use cases documented step by step. The goal is not workflows themselves but the goal is to show how to create them.

That means that in a lot of cases I show some stuff that are maybe not the best practices but that are interesting specific aspects to see and know about.

* [ Send a webex alert if temperature in Paris is less than 25Â° ](https://github.com/pcardotatgit/SecureX_Workflows_and_Stuffs/tree/master/9-JSON_Parsing_within_SecureX)
* [ Secure End Point detect and alert - which host are infected by this malware ](https://github.com/pcardotatgit/SecureX_Workflows_and_Stuffs/tree/master/8-detect_and_alert_workflow_lab)
* [Dashboard and tiles for current temperature in Paris](https://github.com/pcardotatgit/SecureX_Workflows_and_Stuffs/tree/master/6-relay_modules_for_tiles)
* [Create Public Feeds in SecureX for Cisco Secure Firewalls ( SI, CTID, Network Objects, Dynamic Objects )](https://github.com/pcardotatgit/SecureX_Workflows_and_Stuffs/tree/master/12-create_securex_blocking_lists_for_firewalls)
* [Query SecureX for dispositions of observables in security logs](https://github.com/pcardotatgit/check_observable_dispositions_in_CTR_from_an_observable_list)

## Check your workflows or do some reverse engineering on others workflows

I wrote the tool below because needed to quickly check and clean my workflows and document them. Whatis better than a visualization tool for this ?

* [SecureX JSON workflow parser](https://github.com/pcardotatgit/SecureX_Workflow_JSON_Tree_viewer)
* [SecureX Workflow Analyser](https://ciscosecurity.github.io/sxo-05-security-workflows/analyzer)
