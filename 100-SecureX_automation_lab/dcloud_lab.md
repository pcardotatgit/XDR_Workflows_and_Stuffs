# Dcloud SecureX Orchestration Lab

DCLOUD lab environments are shared environments. That means that you might find into the lab you book, thing that was let by users who booked the lab before you.

So the important point here is to not let within DCLOUD tenant any private or critical data. If you develop a workflow into the DCLOUD lab, then you have to think about export it and delete it from DCLOUD.

Another point is if you use your browser to connect to a SecureX tenant before, some data might have been stored into the browser's cache. These data migth create conflicts when you will use the DCLOUD lab. For this reason a best practice when using DCLOUD labs is to open a private windows into your browser.

In general, you can activate the private window by going to your browsers settings ( 3 dots on the top right ), and click on the **new private window** for firefox or **New InPrivate window** for edge, **New Incognito Window** for Chrome.

Other important thing, in your Browser allow popups for the site.

Then you are good to go.   Go to **https://dcloud.cisco.com** , then login with your CCO_ID, Select the **Catalog** Tab on the top menu and Search for **SecureX** in the Search edit field.

Locate the **Cisco SecureX Orchestration v1 - Instant Demo** lab in results and just click on the **View** button in order to book your lab.
